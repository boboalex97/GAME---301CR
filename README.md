# GAME---301CR
Coursework for 301CR - Advanced Games Programming by Bogdan-Alexandru Aionitoaiei.


This is a university project which was assigned in the third year of university, in 
the first semester, which had the aim to help the student to learn how to apply software 
engineering and collaborative programming practices suited for the creation of video games 
by producing a playable game using the C++ programming language. The game tries to emulate 
a 2D, RPG, 8-bit style game and it showcases how the variety of middleware, like SFML 
and Box2D, were implemented in the creation of this demo game.


To run the code, the project needs to get retargeted!


To run the game, the project entitled "Framework" needs to be opened and run. 
For the second player to move, the project entitled "Client" needs to be opened 
and run, a window will appear and from that window, the second player can be controlled. 


To add more rooms to the game and coins in the room a document entitled "level.lua" needs 
to be completed which can be found by opening the folder named "Framework". After opening 
the folder a second one needs to be open, which has the same name as the previous one 
("Framework"), to access the "level.lua" file. A maximum of 10 rooms can be created. 

Here is a link to a short YouTube video which showcases how the project should work:
